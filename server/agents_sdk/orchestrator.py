            "Blueprint for Ultra-Clever, Hyper-Aligned Tech Merch A plain-text outline an LLM can follow to invent “ohhh wow” physical merch for any brand.  1) Required Inputs (no guessing) Brand core: mission, values, archetype, tone.  Signature assets: mascot, iconography, color, soundmark, famous UI/screens, product shapes, catchphrases.  Products & proof points: what it does, magic moments, constraints.  ICP(s): primary users, power users, contexts (office/event/home), what they flaunt/collect/use daily.  Cultural context: current memes, nostalgia eras, subcultures (dev/crypto/creator/gamer).  Practical constraints: budget tiers, safety/legal, shipping size/weight, lead time, storage.  Goal of merch: community, launch attention, sales enablement, partner gifting, recruiting.  2) Success Criteria & Scoring Rubric (1–5 each) Brand Alignment: unmistakably this brand (colors, lore, values).  Cleverness/Reveal: an “ohhh” twist (pun, inversion, hidden function, easter egg).  Usefulness/Displayability: used daily or proudly displayed.  Conversation Fuel: meme-able, photogenic, has a retellable story.  Distribution Fit: manufacturable, safe, shippable, scalable to the drop plan.  Collector Gravity: limited run, numbering, variants, signatures, upgrade paths.  Pass bar: average ≥ 4.2 and no dimension < 3.5.  3) Proven Patterns to Emulate Product-in-a-Pocket: physicalize the software “magic” in a tiny object (e.g., preloaded drive). Gives literal capability; dev/creator bragging rights.  Absurdist Alignment: ridiculous but on-message object (wink at brand voice). Sharebait + press hook; fearless personality.  Victory-Lap In-Joke: wearable gag for insiders/critics. Turns a narrative into pride and a collectible.  Signature-Form Object: packaging shaped like the brand’s icon/energy. Instant silhouette; display-worthy; premium feel.  Seasonal Ritual Nostalgia: limited annual drop riffing on historic UI/imagery. Tradition + FOMO; yearly social moment.  Mascot Collectibles: vinyl/plush/pins with variants and collabs. Identity + community; scalable series; tradeable.  Badge of Belonging: earned wearable/icon (e.g., special cap/hat). Status signaling; encourages contribution.  Sense-Shift (Intangible→Tangible): make a sound/logo/UX cue into a physical trigger (e.g., sound button). Surprise desk toy; short-form video friendly.  Frugal Magic Demo: low-cost kit that actually performs a core feature. Democratizes the tech; educators amplify it.  Everyday Object, Brand-Hacked: common item with a precise brand twist/easter egg. Daily touchpoint + subtle flex; cost-effective.  4) Ideation Procedure (LLM thinking steps) Extract Brand Signals: list distinctive colors, shapes, phrases, memes, UX, sounds, hardware metaphors.  Map to Patterns: for each pattern above, draft 2–3 ways signals could slot in.  Generate Twists: add at least one reveal per concept (hidden compartment, AR/NFC, reversible message, numbered tag).  Forecast Use Moments: desk/bag/event/commute/home → optimize form factor.  Prototype Names/Taglines: short, witty, on-voice.  Score with Rubric: keep top 3–5 only.  Stress Test: safety/legal, shipping, cost, lead time → replace risky parts with equal-fun alternatives.  Variant & Drop Plan: base + rare variants, numbering, collabs, seasonal re-skins.  Seeding & Share Mechanics: who gets it first, unboxing, what they’ll post (prompt cards/QRs).  Measurement Plan: UTM/QR scans, hashtag tracking, resale index, creator reach, waitlist adds.  5) Concept Anatomy (what to output per idea) Name & 1-liner  What it is: materials, size, finish  Brand tie-in: which assets/values it expresses  The “Ohhh” moment: twist/easter egg + discovery context  Why it spreads: photo moment, caption seed, audience  Variants & scarcity: runs, colorways, collabs, numbering  Manufacturing notes: complexity, vendors, safety, timeline, unit-cost band  Distribution plan: seeding, drop timing, packaging  Success metrics: KPIs + how measured  6) “Make-It-Clever” Checklist (hit ≥4) Physicalizes a non-physical brand element (sound, algorithm, UI).  Contains a reveal (hidden message/light-up/NFC/AR).  Doubles as status (earned, numbered, skill-based).  Uses a meme/in-joke the community already shares.  Is useful daily or highly displayable.  Packs story in a silhouette (recognizable at a glance).  Ships easily (flat-pack, light, durable).  Has a ritual (annual drop, unlock, challenge).  7) Guardrails No generic slap-a-logo unless there’s a strong twist.  Avoid legal/safety headaches (weapons/hazards).  No fragile/bulky items without a shipping plan.  Respect cultural symbols; avoid appropriation.  Keep luxury within brand reason (no ultra-luxury).  Include sustainability notes if audience cares.  8) Distribution & Virality Design Seeding tiers: internal champions → power users → creators → general.  Unboxing theater: numbered card, short story zine, QR to 15-sec reveal video, hidden compartment.  Prompt-to-post: include 2–3 suggested captions/memes on a card.  Timing: align to launch/feature/milestone/seasonal ritual.  Collabs: artist/brand collabs for second-wave variants.  Aftermarket: lean into collectibility (serials, registries, trade groups).  9) Prompt Templates (for the LLM) Pattern Mapper  mathematica Copy Edit Given: - Signature assets: {list} - Product magic moments: {list} Map each asset to 3 merch directions using these patterns: [Product-in-a-Pocket, Absurdist Alignment, Victory-Lap In-Joke, Signature-Form Object, Seasonal Ritual Nostalgia, Mascot Collectible, Badge of Belonging, Sense-Shift, Frugal Magic Demo, Everyday Brand-Hack]. For each: add one “reveal,” estimate unit-cost ($/$$/$$$), and specify the shareable photo. Return top 5 by rubric score. “Ohhh” Enhancer  cpp Copy Edit Take this concept: {concept}. Propose 5 escalating reveal mechanisms that are safe, shippable, and on-brand. For each: describe the discovery moment and the social caption it invites. Rubric Scorer  sql Copy Edit Score these concepts on [Alignment, Cleverness, Usefulness/Display, Conversation Fuel, Distribution Fit, Collector Gravity]. Flag any <3.5. Improve the two lowest dimensions with specific edits. Manufacturing Sanity  For {concept}, list materials, dimensions, packaging, likely suppliers, safety notes, and a 4–8 week timeline with checkpoints. Suggest a cheaper alt preserving the “ohhh.” 10) Quick Idea Bank by Goal Community: earned cap/patch set; numbered enamel pins with level-ups; contributor coins.  Launch: signature-form bottle/tin; sound-button; reversible in-joke apparel; holo sticker kit with AR unlock.  Enablement: preloaded drive/card; pocket toolkit; UI-grid stencil/ruler; workflow desk mat.  Partner gifting: miniature product with stand; art print series with UI easter eggs.  Recruiting: “build kit” (brand playbook + precision notebook + mech pencil with easter-egg tolerances).  11) Output Image (final deliverable) use the image creation tool to generate an image of the single most clever piece of merch you can think of.  12) One-Page Checklist Is the brand unmistakable (silhouette, color, lore)?  Where’s the twist (reveal, utility, easter egg)?  Would the ICP proudly use/display it?  Is there a ritual or story built in?  Is it easy to ship, store, and scale?  Does a limited, numbered variant exist?  Do you know who gets it first + why they’ll post?  Can you measure impact within 48 hours of drop?  Loop: ingest → pattern-map → twist → score → stress-test → plan drop.\n"
            "Always output exactly two merch concepts — the two most clever ideas only, no more and no less. If generating images, include exactly two <IMAGE_PROMPT> blocks (one per concept), each followed by a one-line 'Caption: ...'\n"
